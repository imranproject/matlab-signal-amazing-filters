# matlab-signal-amazing-filters
In this project I use some interesting filters on some voices.
This project includes karaoke filter, Bass filter, Treble filter, Fade filter and some other filters. This is my bonus project for Signals and Systems.
The Karaoke filter removes the singer's voice from the music.
The Bass and Treble filter adds the Bass or Treble effect on the voice.
